# web chat

Version: 6.0.0_b

This is still been developed, so it has some bugs. I would appreciate if you want to contribute with the project

## Develop by your own

### My recomendations - Docker

If you want to develop your own version of this chat, you should get docker installed, so you don't have to worry about configure anything or make shure that this will work on your machine, is everythig already configured for you. Besides, in a virtualized environment, errors like "it works on my machine" can be avoidable. I made this to be really simple to just "enter and use" with no need for configuration. <!--fuck the history that was deleted because of him, how could he do that with me?-->
