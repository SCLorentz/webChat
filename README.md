# web chat

Version: 6.5.0_a

This is still been developed, so it has a lot of problems. I would appreciate if you want to contribute with the project

## Develop by your own

### My recomendations - Docker

If you want to develop your own version of this chat, you should get docker installed, so you don't have to worry about configure anything or make shure that this will work on your machine, is everythig already configured for you. Besides, in a virtualized environment, errors like "it works on my machine" can be avoidable. I made this to be really simple to just "enter and use" with no need for configuration. <!--fuck the history that was deleted because of him, how could he do that with me?-->

### Start the server

To start the server, use: `run`, this command will make shure that everything necessary to make this project work is being executed and is working correctly.

tmp: deno run ./src/frontend/scripts/ts/main.ts


## fix errors with gcc at the devcontainer!
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --target-dir=./src/frontend/scripts/web <-- use this to create wasm

GOARCH=386 GOOS=linux go build main.go <-- use this to run the server

There are some problems with 'wasm-pack', don't use it
